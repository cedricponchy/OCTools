/*
 *	TODO: (Some musings as I figure this out)
 *
 *		To handle conditional rules, I want to create a new NFA transition
 *	for the "start state" which signifies the start state transition. That
 *	is, I want to create a new transition state S:
 *
 *		S is transitioned only if the set of start conditions are correct.
 *
 *		There are two sorts of start transitions. First is the list of
 *	defined start rules {A}. Second is the condition if we are at the start
 *	of the line or not.
 *
 *		Behind each transition we then note the transitions forward only to
 *	those states that are permitted by that transition. So, for example, if
 *	we have the following rules:
 *
 *		A: ^...
 *		B: {R}...
 *		C: ...
 *		D: ...
 *
 *		Then we need to create initial NFA transitions representing the
 *	transition through ^ and through {R}.
 *
 *		The DFA transition rules must then be able to differentiate between
 *	transitioning through ^ and not ^, {R} and not {R}. These transition rules
 *	should be handled differently from rules which read characters from the
 *	input stream.
 *
 *	QUESTION: Do we need to track in each NFA constructed the list of valid
 *	states that this NFA operates in? Otherwise, the DFA process may collapse
 *	the rules:
 *
 *		{A}[A-C]+
 *		[A-C]+
 *
 *	since once we move beyond the initial conditional of the {A}, the two
 *	rules look identical. This may also imply we need to track the start
 *	set for the DFA rules being constructed as well.
 *
 *	NOTE: We may need to include a mask to indicate if a DFA can be taken if
 *	start conditional is true, false, or either. This is because the set of
 *	start rules change for two states A and B if A is true, B is true or both
 *	are true. And that implies a new data structure OCStartSet which tracks
 *	all of these possible combinations.
 *
 *	It also implies that transition states in the DFA may need to be picked
 *	depending on the current state and not just the letter read. (This is
 *	because parsing the two states:
 *
 *		{A}"[^"]*"
 *		"(\\.|[^\\"])*"
 *
 *	will diverge with the character sequence "\" if condition A is true.
 *	(It is a legal match to the first rule but not a legal match with the
 *	second.) And that implies for each state in the DFA we need some sort
 *	of indicator if the start state must be validated against during parsing.
 *
 *	NOTE: This raises an interesting problem: if we have a list of start
 *	states as a conditional, ideally the best thing to do is to allow the
 *	start state to permeate down while constructing the DFA in the same way
 *	we handle characters, but with multiple conditionals possibly being
 *	true. This creates the potential of complex AND/OR conditionals during
 *	construction.
 *
 *	I may need to add the start state object and experiment with how it
 *	is transformed during DFA conversion of an NFA state. That's because,
 *	for example,
 *
 *		{A}^...
 *
 *	implies start conditions A AND ^ are both true. This also implies during
 *	DFA construction we have a second set of states, followed if
 *	(NOT A) OR (NOT ^).
 *
 *	This gets more complicated if we have {A,B}^..., which implies
 *
 *		(A OR B) AND ^
 *
 *	and the fork is taken on
 *
 *		(NOT A AND NOT B) OR NOT ^
 *
 *	Because these are start states, I don't think they percolate down
 *	any farther than this. (And I wonder at the feasibility of joining
 *	disjointed states; I suspect that doesn't work.)
 *
 *	NOTE: It could be at the bottom of the stack we wind up generating
 *	a method which contains all the conditional compares to determine the
 *	start state in the final generated code. Despite this we do get a
 *	savings in the final size of the state machine. For example, if we have
 *	a rule:
 *
 *		{A}"[^"]*"
 *		"(\\.|[^\\"])*"
 *
 *	This implies in both state machines the collection of rules followed for
 *	any sequence not starting with a " will be the same.
 *
 *	(How do we guarantee this?)
