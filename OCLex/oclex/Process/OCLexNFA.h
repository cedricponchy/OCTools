/*
 *	TODO: (Some musings as I figure this out)
 *
 *		We need to handle the following case:
 *
 *	<AA>magic         printf("first");
 *	<BB>magic         printf("second");
 *	<CC>magic         printf("third");
 *
 *		where AA, BB and CC can be in any state true/false.
 *
 *	As it turns out this cannot be easily handled by building the appropriate
 *	DFA state machine, unless we are willing to handle all 8 cases. That's
 *	because we cannot know apriori when we're starting the state transitions
 *	if we have something like:
 *
 *	<AA>[Mm]agic
 *	<BB>magic
 *	<CC>Magic
 *	[Mm]agic
 *
 *	The problem being that a set of rules may have multiple possible resulting
 *	states, but only one reulting state is valid once we've parsed that
 *	combination of letters.
 *
 *	And ultimately the start state determines which state we find in the
 *	DFA. Meaning the original top case is identical to:
 *
 *	magic				{ if AA then first, if BB then second, if CC then thrid }
 *
 *	and it may make more sense to handle it in this way: for the final result
 *	state to drop into a piece of code to determine which is the state we're
 *	to handle.
 *
 *	----
 *
 *	Handling ^
 *
 *	The problem with our current code is that:
 *
 *	^[A-Z]+
 *	[A-Z]+
 *
 *	will **fail** and not parse the second rule if the first rule is not true.
 *	Meaning right now it converts to:
 *
 *	[A-Z]*				{ if ^ then first }
 *
 *	and if ^ is not true, then the pattern [A-Z]* is ignored.
 *
 *	So there are two ways to handle it; either wrap it in the same sort of
 *	conditional code as handled above, or create an extra transition that
 *	can optionally happen if we are at the start of the line.
 *
 *	So perhaps the right answer here is:
 *
 *		(1) Replace DFA state with a list of states and conditions.
 *		(2) Remove existing state flag material. (StateFlag, StateCond and
 *	the like. Update StateActions to use a negative number if the rule
 *	is actually a conditional, then use a switch statement to jump into code
 *	which evaluates the conditional.
