	    <h1>OCTools</h1>
	    <p>A suite of tools which serve as a plug-in replacement for yacc and lex. The goal
is to provide a (roughly) source compatible tool which can convert yacc and lex
grammars into Objective C output for building parsers that run on MacOS and iOS.</p>
		<p>This installs ocyacc and oclex to the directory /usr/local/bin, where they can then be used in Xcode.</p>
		<p>Package built on DATE</p>
